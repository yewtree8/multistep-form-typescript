## Multi step form in Vite, Typescript and React

Small applet to test custom hooks and forms at the same time. 

**Vite** also came across my radar so I thought I'd give it a try.

*This is not a "serious" project, just something to test my knowledge on forms, custom hooks, typescript practices and also see what the vite hype was about!*

Feel free to clone and run:

    npm -i

    npm run dev
